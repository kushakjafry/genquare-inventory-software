# Introduction

### Inventroy Mangement App

Based on idea of managing inventories using barcode/SkuId.<br/>
Backend for this application available [here](https://github.com/kushakjafry/genquare-inventory-server)  
This project is bootstraped by using the template from [maximegris/angular-electron](https://github.com/maximegris/angular-electron).<br/><br/>

Currently runs with:

- Angular v10.0.14
- Electron v9.3.0
- Electron Builder v22.8.0

## Getting Started

Clone this repository locally :

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kushakjafry/genquare-inventory-software.git
```

Install dependencies with npm :

```bash
npm install
```

There is an issue with `yarn` and `node_modules` when the application is built by the packager. Please use `npm` as dependencies manager.

If you want to generate Angular components with Angular-cli , you **MUST** install `@angular/cli` in npm global context.
Please follow [Angular-cli documentation](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) if you had installed a previous version of `angular-cli`.

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

## To build for development

- **in a terminal window** -> npm start

Voila! You can use your Angular + Electron app in a local development environment with hot reload !

The application code is managed by `main.ts`. In this sample, the app runs with a simple Angular App (http://localhost:4200) and an Electron window.
The Angular component contains an example of Electron and NodeJS native lib import.
You can disable "Developer Tools" by commenting `win.webContents.openDevTools();` in `main.ts`.

## Use Electron / NodeJS / 3rd party libraries

As see in previous chapter, this sample project runs on both mode (web and electron). To make this happens, **you have to import your dependencies the right way**. Please check `providers/electron.service.ts` to watch how conditional import of libraries has to be done when using electron / NodeJS / 3rd party librairies in renderer context (ie. Angular).

## Browser mode

Maybe you only want to execute the application in the browser with hot reload ? Just run `npm run ng:serve:web`.
